## Getting started

This project is generated by Scriptless Automation based on an exploratory session {{portalUrl}}/sessions/{{manualSessionId}}, allowing you to run automated Appium tests with multiple devices on Kobiton/other platforms.

## Prerequisites

### Run on Kobiton platform

- Access Kobiton ({{portalUrl}}/settings/keys) to get your API Keys
- Then, update `API_KEY` in `src/test/config.js` file

### Run on SauceLabs platform

- Access SauceLabs Platform Configurator (https://app.saucelabs.com/platform-configurator) to get your configuration
- Then, update the `src/test/config.js` file:
    - Set `API_USERNAME` and `API_KEY` to your SauceLabs Username and Access Key
    - Set `APPIUM_SERVER_URL` to the appropriate URL (e.g. https://ondemand.us-west-1.saucelabs.com:443/wd/hub)
    - Set `DEVICE_SOURCE` to `DEVICE_SOURCES.OTHER`
    - Replace the existing capabilities with SauceLabs's capabilities
    - Specify Appium version 1.x in the capabilities for better compatibility by adding `appiumVersion` in `sauce:options`

### Run on BrowserStack platform

- Access BrowserStack dashboard (https://automate.browserstack.com/dashboard) to get your configuration
- Then, update the `src/test/config.js` file:
    - Set `API_USERNAME` and `API_KEY` to your BrowserStack User Name and Access Key
    - Set `APPIUM_SERVER_URL` to the appropriate URL (https://hub-cloud.browserstack.com/wd/hub)
    - Set `DEVICE_SOURCE` to `DEVICE_SOURCES.OTHER`
    - Replace the existing capabilities with BrowserStack's capabilities
    - Use Appium version 1.x and W3C protocol for better compatibility by adding `appiumVersion` and setting `browserstack.use_w3c` to `true` in your capabilities

### Run on LambdaTest platform

- Access LambdaTest dashboard (https://accounts.lambdatest.com/dashboard) to get your configuration
- Then, update the `src/test/config.js` file:
    - Set `API_USERNAME` and `API_KEY` to your LambdaTest Username and Access Key
    - Set `APPIUM_SERVER_URL` to the appropriate URL (https://hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub)
    - Set `DEVICE_SOURCE` to `DEVICE_SOURCES.OTHER`
    - Replace the existing capabilities with LambdaTest's capabilities
    - Specify Appium version 1.x in the capabilities for better compatibility by adding `appiumVersion`

## Environment Setup
