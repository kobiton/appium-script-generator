# Contributing to Appium Script Generator

Contributions are always appreciated and welcome, no matter how large or small! Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

There are several ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Make changes to this repository

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository, make changes, and submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the `master` branch. This project is the source code of a Node.js application written in Javascript following the ES6 standard. Please make sure the unit tests/lint pass before sending a pull request. For more information on how to run tests/lint, please read [README](./README.md).

Something that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Rebase with the latest code from the upstream.
* Follow the existing coding style.
* Write unit tests.
* Write a good commit message. When you have a lot of commits in your pull request, it is good practice to squash all your commits in one single commit.
* For a major fix/feature request make sure your pull request has a related issue and if it does not, please create one. This would help discussion with the community, and polishing ideas in case of a new feature request.
